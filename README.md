# Shopping Database

## Simple shopping database. (Java Spring Boot)
## THIS SIMPLE DATABASE HAS THREE ENTITIES.
### -> Product (Id, name, price, expireDate)
### -> User (Id, name, surname, email, phoneNumber)
### -> ProductComment (Id, comment, commentDate, productId, userId)
### Our entities has relationship eachother as you can see. So we have to create relationships with annotations.
### In three entity files (model files in my project), you can see annotations refers to relationships. Also, in three controller files you can see the apis i wrote.
### Let's take a deep look on our API's.
