# Shopping Database

## Simple shopping database. (Java Spring Boot)
## THIS SIMPLE DATABASE HAS THREE ENTITIES.
### -> Product (Id, name, price, expireDate)
### -> User (Id, name, surname, email, phoneNumber)
### -> ProductComment (Id, comment, commentDate, productId, userId)
### As you can see, our entities have relationships with each other. So we need to create relationships with annotations.
### In the three entity files (model files in my project) you can see annotations referring to the relationships. Also, you can see the apis I wrote in the three controller files.
### Let's take a deep look on our API's.
